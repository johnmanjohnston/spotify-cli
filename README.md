# spotify-cli

A frontend for Spotify, that lets you interact with Spotify from the command line. Unlike other Spotify CLI frontends, **my adaptation does not require you to have Premium**, which means that you can use this adaptation entirely for free.
My implementation also has features like automatic muting of advertisements (TO DO), and free downloading of playlists (TO DO).
