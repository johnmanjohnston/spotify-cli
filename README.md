# spotify-cli

A frontend for Spotify, that lets you interact with Spotify from the command line. Unlike other Spotify CLI frontends, **my adaptation does not require you to have Premium**, which means that you can use this adaptation entirely for free.
My implementation audio has feature like automatic muting of advertisements (TO DO).
